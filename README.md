*This is a mini Streamlit application to try, experiment and/or test new segmentation and recognition models trained with Kraken on your own images.*

*This app build with pedagogical purpose to show how to use Kraken models and what are the steps in generic OCR/HTR pipeline before start a real or much bigger project.*

üìä To evaluate the recognition model performance on your data, you can use [KaMI-App](https://github.com/KaMI-tools-project/KaMI-app), a generic metric dashboard app for OCR/HTR models.


### Install & run the app locally

create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
